## 📗 DESCRIPTION

It adds a variety of customization options to entity nameplates. It lets you fine-tune how nameplates look and behave—such as enabling text shadows, adding subtle “eye” physics to make nameplates hide behind objects to look more natural, showing or hiding your own nameplate, and many other adjustable visual features. Perfect for players who want more personality, clarity, or style in their game’s nameplates.

## ✨ KEY FEATURES

* **Text shadows;** for clearer, more stylish nameplates.
* **Eye physics;** to make nameplates hide behind objects to look more natural.
* **Self nameplate;** to show or hide own nameplate.
